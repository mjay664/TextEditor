# TextEditor
A fun project, with a very simple idea i.e. encrypt text. After typing, there will two options to save a file, first one is to save it in simple text format or save it so only you can read it. The latter one uses a user given password to encrypt text.
Before encryption hash of text is calculated that is append to header and footer with some flags. Hash is used to verify if file was modified, and flags are to know that file is saved securely.
This project was developed in Java using Netbeans IDE.
